# 3D-Map-Explorer-
Converts a 2-Dimensional user map, into a 3D rendering that allows the user to explore the map environment in first person. 
User may edit player map on any editor to add more obstacles or Walls and explore the created environment in 3D. 
When editing map replace (.) characters with ('x') to add a wall, or vice versa  ('x') with a (.) to remove a wall, 
do not alter map dimensions or replace the asterix character on the map. 

Future Updates to be made: 

+ Add placement feature that allows the user to place new obstacles in 3D environment in realtime. 
+ Improve texture of floor, walls and ceiling.
+ Extend to include a map resizing functionality
